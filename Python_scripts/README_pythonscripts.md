# README

This folder contains different files for the analysis and visualization of data in relation with SATAY experiments.

Most of the scripts use files that are created using the data processing pipeline as described [here](https://github.com/Gregory94/LaanLab-SATAY-DataAnalysis/blob/master/docs/satay_analysis_notes.pdf).

Many scripts use custom modules that are located in the [python_modules folder](https://github.com/Gregory94/LaanLab-SATAY-DataAnalysis/tree/dev_Gregory/Python_scripts/python_modules).
Each scripts starts with an explaination when and how to use the module.
